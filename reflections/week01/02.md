## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
It's a tag added to an element that changes how that element might react, like hovering over a button. That's the one I've seen used most often so far.
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is the order in which the styling takes place. Everthing runs top to bottom but adding different style selectors changes which style might take precident. Adding a higher specificity selector enables you to easily change the style of specific elements.
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
It makes it impossible to override.
