## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
To create a mock sketch of a page design to be approved by users, stakeholders and the like, before moving into the coding process.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low fidelity is a basic design lacking in images, color or much detail and can be done in moments with as little as pen and paper. Mid fidelity improves upon low fidelity with more detail but uses generic images and text as a placeholder before the final design. High fidelity can create a highly detailed sketch of the page mock-up including images and more stylistic choices.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Absolutely! Seeing how quickly and efficiently someone can use Figma, I can see how beneficial it could be before spending hours coding a page only to have someone say they don't like it and you have to do it all over again.
