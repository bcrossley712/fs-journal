## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
When you plan first it can give you a better direction and stucture to move forward. but over planning can be a waste of time.
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Google, take a break, step up and re-think.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
I know he said his article wasn't meant to frustrate of discourage new programers but dang if he didn't try hard.  Pointing out so many things that are "newbie" code markers and so many "DO NOT DO" these, makes learning sound even more daunting.  So much of what was said I recognize as things that I've done knowing that there must be a better way but he made them sound as though I was committing a crime by doing it, all the while trying to reinforce the fact that you will make these mistakes and to just don't do them... Not my favorite article but I see his overall big picture that as a new programmer, you could find yourself falling into easy mistakes and to learn from them rather than continuing to make them.
