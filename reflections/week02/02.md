## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
Declaration, expression, arrow expression. Declaration is hoisted so it can be invoked before it is defined. The others cannot and can only be used within their scope.
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are values within the function that are open-ended and must be provided a value. Arguments supply those values to the function through the parameter.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
When a function returns another function or a function accepts another function as a parameter.  array.filter is a higher order function.
