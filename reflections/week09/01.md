## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We created checklists and called to two API's. Our own api to save all the information that is input and an external api to gather recipe ingrefdients that can then be put into our own checklists. We utilized vue and node.js. 
2. What went well so far?
Most eveything in our project went swimmingly well. We coordinated very well and had very frew instances where we had to backtrack and reset what we were doing.
3. What would you do differently? Why?
I'm very happy with the work we were able to accomplish. If I could have one thing change it would be to have someone on our team with a fine eye for style to improve upon the stylistics.
