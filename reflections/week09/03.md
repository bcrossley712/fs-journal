## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
It would deliver images embedded directly into the HTML or CSS to get around waiting in a queue for the images to load.
2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
It increases the size of the file by upwards of 25% thereby increasing the download time and increases the bandwith usage.
3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
Since the introduction of HTTP/2, web browsers have become very efficient in delivering hundreds of files through a single connection avoiding that dreaded queue.
