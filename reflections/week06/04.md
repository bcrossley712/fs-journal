## Questions

1. What is a nested route?
A nested route is a route continuing on the path of another.
2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
We have been using them to go to specific instances of a larger group of items.  For example a single blog from a list of blogs, or a single user profile from a list of users. Could also be beneficial to just to keep organized along topics.
3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes. The parameters have been used to pass specific routes into the code to then call to an API with that specific information.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Vue has been both a very nice tool to expand options and code but also very difficult for me to learn the syntax.  I believe I'm finally starting to get the hang of it and can see how much easier Vue is with accomplishing certain things then the MVC pattern.
