# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  
Yesterday I got all graded. The only thing that was missing was a whoops of me putting a single = instead of a ==.  You would think that after this amount of time that I would stop doing that.  Although I must say that it is easily recognizable to me now when it does happen.  Now I'm focusing on creating a landing page for me.  I had my exit intervidew with Brittany today.  I kept my notepad with me to try to reference some talking points because I do tend to forget those points when I'm put on the spot.  It went surprisingly well.  She did ask that I try to not ramble in certain parts of my pitch and to practice my pitch more.
## Prompts
- How is today going?
