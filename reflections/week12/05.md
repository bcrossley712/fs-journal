# Final Reflection
The Final Week, The Final day of Course Work. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?
It's really bitter sweet for me.  I've very much enjoyed this course and am both looking forward to and bummed that we are finishing up.  I'm exited to talk to some different employers this upcoming week to see what I'm getting myself in to. üòÅ
