# Daily Reflection
One day left are you going to make it? We believe in you!ðŸ’–! Are you timeboxing appropriately? 
This week has been a blast.  Because of the fact that I was finished early in the week it was a very low-key low-stress week.  I finished up my lading page and got a little feedback from Sam.  It's a simple papge with a simple design but conveys a little about me and my capabilities and hopefully will make anyone who lands on it hungry for more and they will follow up.
## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?
