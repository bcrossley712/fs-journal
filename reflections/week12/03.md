# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  
Today I completely started over with my landing page because I was overcomplicating it.  I started over with a premade bootstrap template that really simplified it.  I'm really glad to see so many of my co-students finishing up the project and getting a passing grade.  I did my technical interview with Mark and it went about as I expected, albeit the problem he gave me was a simple one.  I am pretty nervous when I step up to the plate but I kept my composure and only really had to backtrack once.  I wrote some psudo code that was unhelpful and next time will try my best to write out my thought process.
