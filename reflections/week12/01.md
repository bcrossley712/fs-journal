# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 
If you'd have asked me last week I would have told you that I was cramming hard and was trying to squeeze in as much time coding as possible.  Aparently it worked for me because this weekend I only put in probably a couple 8 hour days and I was able to come in this morning and easily finish up.  Having tried to do AllSpice in it's entirety in only 3 days helped me when it came time to s=do the final. Last week was integral and it really solidified eveything that I was struggling on in AllSpice.  I was worried about the postman tests, but it turned out unfounded worrying.
