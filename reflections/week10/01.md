## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value type is a data type that directly contains values. Reference types store the address of where the value is.  Pointer types are a little different and I don't quite understand them. They have referent types and only an unmanaged type can be a referent type.
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Bool, int, char. C sharp definetly is much more strict where eveything has to have a type defined.
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
I don't understand it.  I see that the reference type gets stored in memory as an number index and it's called upon through that number but I guess I just don't understand what's being asked.  The value type on the other hand uses it's own value as the address in memory.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
C sharp as I currently understand it uses much of the same logic from JavaScript but the syntax will definetly take some getting used to. I find that google will become my friend.
