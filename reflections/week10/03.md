## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
Columns define the information that will be inserted into the table whereas the rows are the information that has been entered.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE characters(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INT,
  description TEXT
) DEFAULT charset utf8;
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
The DELETE FROM will delete a row from the table given an id whereas the DROP will delete the entire table.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today gave me a great introduction to SQL. I am really starting to grasp the basic concept of it and can see it's benefit. While trying to assist another student in what I understood, I caught Mark's attention and he helped further clarify the differences between Mongo/Mongoose and SQL/dapper.
