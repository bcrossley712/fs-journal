## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
A list is a strongly typed list of values. It can be of any type that is specified within the <>.
2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
.Find, .Add, .FindIndex, .Contains, List[index]. Basically all of the methods that I would previously use for arrays within JS can now be used functionally within C#.
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
I would use .Find and look for the item with a double equals.
