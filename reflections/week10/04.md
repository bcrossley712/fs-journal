## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
An Enum is a strogly typed constraint that can be used to assign symbolic names to integral values. In the example given, volume to low medium or high. Or like North, south east west.
2. How can you modify an Enum?
An enum becomes just like any other type of object that you can have and can be used as such.  You can use a switch statement to decide what to do with it once it's delcared and initialized.
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
We have not so far used enum in C#. We spoke about them briefly for use on a many to many relationship and I hope we get to better understand them.
