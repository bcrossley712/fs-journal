## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It can show your knowledge base, a way to prove you know what you're doing, increase your personal brand and  it can really make you stand out from a croud of applicants.
2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
It can make you stand out to a potential employer.  If you take your 3-4 best skills and build projects with them and make them look great, it gives you a very good starting point to talk about.
3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
The Tower was a very good example of the work I can do. It showcases that I can take a high-fidelity mock and almost perfectly recreate it. There isn'e much in the line of creativity but it'll be good to show that I know how to stick to a guide.

Monday was the last day of the gauntlet. It was a very good opportunity for me to fine-tune pieces of the Tower that I felt weren't up to snuff.
