## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit testing can test individual units of code in isolation and provide confidence to the developer knowing that it is functioning as written.  Componant testing attatches the units to a DOM in order to fully asert that they are working. E2E testing provides a holistic aproach and tests the entire application as deployed for production
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
Personally I think that the method of BCW has been of great value to me even though I have a tough time imploementing it.  Code small test small
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
If you test each unit as you move along the program, you should know that the whole program is functioning fully before ever deploying an E2E test.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
As we are moving forward with our project I'm finding that it's moving much slower than anticipated.  I'm quite sure that the vast majority of the slowdowns are caused because of a lack of decisions made before we cross particular bridges.  I think that if you don't have to worry about decision making or stylistic choises that you could code 10 times as fast.
