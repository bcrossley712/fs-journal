## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
Only allowing yourself a specific amount of time to complete a certain task.
2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
I will definetely be applying some sort of 2 minute rule. when I spend too much time looking at an issue it starts to turn my brain to mush and I don't accomplish anything. I'll move on and try to revisit the problem.
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
I don't recall using timeboxing. If I have it has been the strategy of revisiting a problem after I'm stumped.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
