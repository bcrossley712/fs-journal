## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
Embedding can get the information with a single call where the linking of them just links the two objects together.
3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
Largely it is easiest to make the decision by lookin at the potential relationships and establish a balance.  If it seems the relationship sways heavily in one direction then one way embedding will probably be the best approach. Likewise if the relationships seem to be similar going both ways then a two way relationship may be appropriate.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I need to not be so hesitant to compare my code to the examples from lecture or from the model. When I try to go it on my own I tend to miss small things that cause bigger issues. However this is beneficial when it comes to debugging training. ðŸ˜€
