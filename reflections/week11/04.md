## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
As I come to the end of the course, I am extreamly happy with what I've been able to learn and accomplish.  I came into the course not knowing what I would gain from it and it has far exceeded what I could have hoped for. One of the things that I really found to enjoy is the ability to help others who are struggling through problems. I never considered myself a teacher but saw how easily I slipped into the roll in certain situations.  During this upcoming week I plan to timebox better and make sure and take breaks, especcially when I find myself stuck on a problem.
