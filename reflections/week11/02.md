## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
Primary keys are keys that identify the primary identifying property on the table. A foreign key references a different tables primary key and thereby creates a relationship between the two.
2. What is an `Alias`?
We can provide an alias for a naming convention when using SQL. It honestly just makes it easier than writing it out every time.
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
SELECT
d.*
p.*
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p ON p.id = d.patientsId
WHERE d.id = id
