## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
To bundle data and methods to act on that data where the access to the data is inaccessable from outside. To ensure that the data being accessed is only the data that was intended to be provided. It can be a powerful tool to prevent bugs resulting from a shared state.
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
Breaking changes, leaked implementation details, expanded attack surface for hackers and self documenting code.
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
Either through private fields or closures but we've been signifying private functions with an underscore above the exported data.  The user does not need access to the method or function they just need the value of what is provided from those functions.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Loved the organization aspect of the MVC but it has been interesting to learn the different syntax. I'm still struggling with the simple concepts of when to write which function and taking things one step at a time.
