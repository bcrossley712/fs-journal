The constant push and pull of information.

Subscribe, unsubscribe and broadcast.
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
The magic is in mystery... haha.  With the use of these wonderful tools we are able to set up listeners in our apps.  Although still just scratching the surface, I can definetely see the major benefit of these functions.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I'm finding that I'm able to troubeshoot some of my own issues with some of the tools on my belt but after looking at my code I am positive there are many ways in which I could clean up my code. Now I just need to gain that knowledge to employ more tools to my belt.
