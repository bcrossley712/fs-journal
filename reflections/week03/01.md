## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
The ability to export from module to module stops developers from having to put multiple script tags into their HTML which would slow the performance of the page.
2. How does export differ from export default?
From what I understand it seems to make giving an alias easier. I don't quite understand other than you can leave out the '* as' when importing a default value.
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
Every declaration can only be accessed by the module it is in unless exported and imported. It makes for a more organized code, easier debugging, increased performance through concantinating scripts, and the code can be split up making it easier to read.
