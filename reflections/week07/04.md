# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
Mostly we spoke through all of our coding and rubber ducky-ed off each other.  One was typing while the other navigated.
2. What went well this week?
Being able to have another person there to help troubleshoot and walk through issues was very handy.
3. What would you do differently?
We had a clear plan to start and it helped immensly in the layout. At times it seemed as though we jumped around from one thing to another as the logic dictated. I think that It would have been beneficial to not stray far before completing a task completely rather than coming back to it multiple times.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
This was a whole new experience and it was an eye opening one.  On the one hand I can see how if two individuals with near equal knowledge can greatly benefit one another. On the other hand I understand how difficult it can be for two with a wide gap in skill level, one may feel like they're being held back.
