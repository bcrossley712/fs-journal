# Bootstrap

Basically a bunch of CSS written for us.

Start with linking it to our HTML. By dropping into the head of the document:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

Update meta tag:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Bootstrap Java script:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

Resets many browser defaults

Rules:
#1 Read the docs
#2 Use example componants
#3 Never violate the grid system

Use proper nesting: Container>Row>Column

Columns add up to 12
  If more than 12, it will by default wrap under.

Input mobile resposivness early on.

When you add margin to column, you'll break the rule of 12 and wrap the excess down.
