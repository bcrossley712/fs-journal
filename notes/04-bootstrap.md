# Bootstrap

Basically a bunch of CSS written for us.

Start with linking it to our HTML. By dropping into the head of the document:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

Update meta tag:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Resets many browser defaults

Rules:
#1 Read the docs
#2 Use example componants
#3 Never violate the grid system

Use proper nesting: Container>Row>Column

Columns add up to 12
