**3.** What is Encapsulation?

Local retention and protection and hiding of state process. Or the object stores its state privately and only the objects methods have access to the state.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Single responsibility

**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

A class is setting up the blueprint of what a class describes where the instance of the class is when you input the values into it and you get the object from it.

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It separates the responsibilities of communicating with the DOM.  It ultimately makes it harder for the user to access information that wasn't indended for them to access and ensures they use the program as you intended.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
To take information from and update the DOM.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Service is the business logic.  It's where most of the code will happen.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
